# Review&Go
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/haritzmedina/reviewAndGo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/haritzmedina/reviewAndGo)

Review&Go is a chrome extension to allow conference and journal reviewers to review papers using annotations. 
Main features:
* Ease to install.  Review&Go is just two-click away. If you have previously installed any browser extension, installing Review&Go is a doddle! Last but not least, Review&Go is being certified by Chrome, before being uploaded to its web store. So, no security leaks.
* Color-coding highlighting. You define a  Review Model (e.g., originality, legibility and so on), each modelâ€™s attribute is mapped to a colour to be used during highlighting at review time,
* Qualify highlighting. Highlights can be associated with comments, grades (strengths and weaknesses) or references to the literature. Your comments would undertake a sentiment analysis to avoid offensive wordings.
* Canvas view. Have a global picture of the review so far. The canvas is plotted along with the attributes of the review model. Gradations and highlights are shown within each plot.
* Review-draft generation. A first text draft is generated as a review head-start. Comments are placed by the manuscript quotes for authors to easily spot the rationales for the reviewer comments. 
* Sharing. Data is stored locally. Yet, it can be exported as a JSON file and emailed to colleagues who can then import it into their Review&Go installations. On loading the manuscript, your colleagues will see the very same view as you. 


# For End-users

## Globals

The build tool also defines a variable named `process.env.NODE_ENV` in your scripts. It will be set to `development` unless you use the `--production` option.


**Example:** `./app/background.js`

```javascript
if(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'){
  console.log('We are in development mode!');
}
```
